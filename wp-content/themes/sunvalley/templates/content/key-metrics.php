	<p>Many approaches such as the Balanced Scorecard or Objectives Matrix tries to balance the need for hard and soft measures. Management assumes that metrics will spur greater performance, bring focus to priorities and foster collaboration to achieve results.</p>
	<p>In our experience, they rarely do. Most metrics are primarily focused on measuring functional performance based on organizational design. The metrics of the vice-president cascades down to the metrics of his or her subordinates along reporting lines. In reality, organizations succeed when their overall processes are efficient which spans across functions. This generates multiple conflicts between functional priorities and process or customer priorities. The organization oscillate between the two requirements while organizational performance suffers.</p>

	<p>Efficiency metrics are replaced by effectiveness metrics as the prime measure of success. Agile and responsive systems provide more value to customers and markets than efficiency and cost reduction. Therefore, key metrics should be formulated around business systems and their synchronization.</p>
