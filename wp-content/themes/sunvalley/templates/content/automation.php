	<p>The new world of robotic process automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning all hold immense promise to change the world of work. However, the underlying assumptions for deploying these capabilities pose a significant risk to the overall success and profitability of the business.</p>
	<p>If these machine-based capabilities are primarily focused on cost reduction, then the risk far outweigh the gains.</p>

			<p>As the business world increases the demand for responsiveness, reliability and adaptability, processes that are embedded in machine-driven systems become less able to meet those requirements. It is very difficult to uninstall machine-driven processes once they are linked to other systems and processes.</p>

	<p>To deal with the inevitable increase in exceptions and out-of-scope system demands, people develop more and more shadow systems to deal with increased variability of demand and accelerated responsiveness. Companies frequently end up with higher operating expense than before RPA was implemented driving declining profitability.</p>
	<p>The crucial, and often missing piece, is to design the business system to support the external business strategy before implementing automation. We’ve had managers tell us “we are digitizing our process failures rather than restructuring for success” To insure Robotic Process Automation, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make the whole deliver better results than the parts, management should carefully consider the strategic questions?</p>
