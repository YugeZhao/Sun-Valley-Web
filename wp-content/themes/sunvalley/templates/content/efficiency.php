	<p>Efficiency is considered an important goal by many companies. It is driven by the frame of reference that maximum utilization of resource capacity drives lowest cost and therefore maximum profitability and gains in market share. Our conviction is that this frame of reference now results in inevitable corporate destruction.  This is driven by the shift in the global business landscape stemming from the advent of big data.  With data deployment transitioning from a substitute for paper recording to that of driving artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
	<p>In the new world, customers expect on-demand response, customized deliverables and maximum optionality – in other words, maximum effectiveness to meet increasingly unpredictable demand, shorter response windows and in-process changes in deliverables. This is exactly the opposite set of requirements that an efficiency-focused organization strives to achieve.  The more efficient the business systems become the less effective the company becomes. Market share decreases, profitability decreases and operating expense decreases as the conflict between sub-systems increase. USA companies that are prime examples of this dynamic are General Electric and Procter & Gamble.</p>
	<p>Building an effectiveness-focused organization requires a wholesale reset of the fundamental frame of reference about achieving business success. The core differences are contrasted below:</p>
