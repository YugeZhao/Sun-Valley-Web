	<p>Projects have one defining feature which make or break project budgets: Project variability and execution risk. Traditional critical path and PERT-based approaches no longer meet the elevated performance requirements for rapid execution, dependable project completion commitments and predictable cost. Our work over the past 20 years with flow-based project execution tools versus capacity-based tools have proven 30% reduction in project duration and 97%+ on-time project completion performance.</p>

		<p>Rather than measuring each task, our approach, based on the pioneering work of Dr. Eli Goldratt, introduces the concept of buffer management.</p>

<div class="row type-1">
	<p>Buffer management enables management to externalize, evaluate and act on task variation before the project due date is placed at risk. The concept is illustrated below:</p>

			<p>The buffers are not contingency allowances but represent a window into the buffer consumption relative to the due date. Tracking buffer penetration over time enables management to see variation over time as shown below:</p>

		<div class="box image-content">
			<p>The same concept applies to managing a portfolio of projects which provides a single management view of all projects and their progress. The buffer chart below shows the status of all projects in the portfolio:</p>
