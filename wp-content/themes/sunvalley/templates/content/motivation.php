	<p>There is no shortage of theories on human motivation and how it affects productivity and performance. The problem is that few can be used as managerial tools to actively manage corporate motivation. Talking to the Executive Vice President of Human Resources at a Fortune 50 company, she admitted that the annual employee survey was a sham. Employees quickly learn that any criticism results in unwanted management attention and “retraining.” Every variable is rated at “very good” in order to discharge the duty as painless and expedient as possible. The disconcerting aspect is that many CEO’s believe the results reflect reality and congratulate themselves on their managerial prowess.</p>

			<p>We set out in 2001 to research and develop a model that best measures and interprets organizational motivation rather than individual motivation. This model is now used across the world as a well-developed, well-structured management tool. Based on the best-selling book ‘Great Boss-Dead Boss” by Ray Immelman the tribal motivation model provides actionable insights into the true state of motivation across all levels and functions in an organization. Using a cloud-based measurement platform and truly untraceable feedback, management gets an accurate picture of the state of commitment and motivation. Simple graphical representation provides powerful insight and guidance, an example shown on the left.</p>
