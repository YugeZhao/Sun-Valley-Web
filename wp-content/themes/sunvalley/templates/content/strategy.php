<p>The legacy of good or bad strategy defines the success of any chief executive officer.</p>

<p>A powerful strategy generates 30 times greater return than a poor strategy. Strategy is the single most important thing that the CEO and his management team will be judged by - now and into the future. If you judge the performance of Amazon to that of General Electric, no clearer example can be found to prove our point. However, the formulation of strategy is changing.</p>

<p>Cost reduction is not one of them. Constant re-organization is not that either. Setting stretch goals is not.</p>

<p>To determine which constraint your company should own, the following steps apply:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>Identify, understand the large business systems in your competitive space.</p></li>
			<li><p>Determine which system can or will provide the greatest value to your customer base.</p></li>

			<li><p>Execute and constantly realign priorities, projects and resources to reinforce the company’s control of the asset.</p></li>
